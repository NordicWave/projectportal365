﻿# Project Portal for Office 365 [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.0-yellow.svg)](https://semver.org)

The Office 365 Project Portal is an Office 365 project management tool based on <a href="http://prosjektveiviseren.no">Project Wizard</a>. <a href="http://www.puzzlepart.com/prosjektportalen-365/">More information on Puzzlepart's website.</a>

## What is the Office 365 Project Portal?

The Office 365 Project Portal is built by <a href="http://www.puzzlepart.com">Puzzlepart AS</a>. The solution includes Office 365 and SharePoint customizations that together constitute a Project Management Tool. A Portfolio page is set up where you get an overview of projects and can create new project rooms. Each project area is created as an Office 365 group and some lists, some standard elements and logic are set up to execute a project according to the project wizard model. The project wizard is Difi's recommended project model for the implementation of digitization projects in public companies.

The project portal was developed for Asker municipality and Kommit. The version available here was developed by Puzzlepart based on the same principles as the original version.
